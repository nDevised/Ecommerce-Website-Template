# Tech-Ecommerce-Template

A simple E-commerce website template that you can adapt to any website you would like<br>
Firstly, set up a MySQL database on your host computer and create a database called "authDB"<br>
Run this website by installing node.js on your computer, then run the app.js file with node<br>
The server will be hosted on localhost:3000

# Functionalities
Currently, the backend login and sign up works with the database. Still working on forgot password and the email confirmation part which I'll make in the next iteration.<br>

The slideshow works on the frontend with some placeholder images, and so does the products page's brand selector (though I need to load the products from the DB as right now they are just place holders).
